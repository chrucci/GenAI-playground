    "In this example, we show how you can build a simple chat bot by sending and updating context with your requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce the Context Variables object which in this demo functions similarly as a key-value store that you can use when running the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The context is local (i.e. in your computer's RAM) and not persisted anywhere beyond the life of this Jupyter session.\n",
    "\n",
    "In future examples, we will show how to persist the context on disk so that you can bring it into your applications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chat scenario, as the user talks back and forth with the bot, the context gets populated with the history of the conversation. During each new run of the kernel, the context can provide the AI with its variables' content. "
