      "high, supply chains are stretched, and the war in Ukraine is \n",
      "ongoing. At the same time, we are entering a technological era with the potential to power awesome advancements \n",
      "across every sector of our economy and society. As the world’s largest\n",
      "software company, this places us at a historic \n",
      "intersection of opportunity and responsibility to the world around us.  \n",
      "Our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more has never been more \n",
      "urgent or more\n",
      "necessary. For all the uncertainty in the world, one thing is clear: People and organizations in every \n",
      "industry are increasingly looking to digital technology to overcome today’s challenges and emerge stronger. And no \n",
      "company is better positioned\n",
      "to help them than Microsoft.  \n",

      "what technology can do with what the world needs  it to do.  \n",
      "Here are just a few examples:  \n",
      "•\n",
      "Ferrovial, which builds and manages some of the world’s busiest airports and highways, is using our cloud \n",
      "infrastructure to build safer roads as it prepares for a future of autonomous transportation.  \n",

      "One of the world’s largest robotics companies, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, is using the breadth of our tools —\n",
      "from Azure IoT and HoloLens —to create an industrial metaverse solution that brings its distributed workforce \n",
      "together with its network of\n",
      "connected equipment to improve productivity and keep employees safe.  \n",
      "• Globo, the biggest media and TV company in Brazil, is using Power Platform to empower its employees to \n",

      "schedules.  \n",
      "• And Ørsted, which produces a quarter of the world’s wind energy, is using the Microsoft Intelligent Data \n",
      "Platform to turn data from its offshore turbines into insights for predictive maintenance.  \n",
      "Amid this dynamic environment, we\n",

      "OUR RESPONSIBILITY  \n",
