      "of the class, and then we'll start to  talk a bit about machine learning.  \n",
      "By way of introduction, my name's  Andrew Ng and I'll be instru ctor for this class. And so \n",
      "I personally work in machine learning, and I' ve worked on it for about 15 years now, and \n",
      "I actually think that machine learning is th e most exciting field of all the computer \n",
      "sciences. So I'm actually always excited about  teaching this class. Sometimes I actually \n",
      "think that machine learning is not only the most exciting thin g in computer science, but \n",
      "the most exciting thing in all of human e ndeavor, so maybe a little bias there.  \n",
      "I also want to introduce the TAs, who are all graduate students doing research in or \n",
      "related to the machine learni ng and all aspects of machin e learning. Paul Baumstarck \n",
      "works in machine learning and computer vision.  Catie Chang is actually a neuroscientist \n",
      "who applies machine learning algorithms to try to understand the human brain. Tom Do \n",
      "is another PhD student, works in computa tional biology and in sort of the basic \n",
      "fundamentals of human learning. Zico Kolter is  the head TA — he's head TA two years \n",
      "in a row now — works in machine learning a nd applies them to a bunch of robots. And \n",
      "Daniel Ramage is — I guess he's not here  — Daniel applies l earning algorithms to \n",
      "problems in natural language processing.  \n",
      "So you'll get to know the TAs and me much be tter throughout this quarter, but just from \n",
      "the sorts of things the TA's do, I hope you can  already tell that machine learning is a \n",
      "highly interdisciplinary topic in which just the TAs find l earning algorithms to problems \n",
      "in computer vision and biology and robots a nd language. And machine learning is one of \n",
      "those things that has and is having a large impact on many applications.  \n",
      "So just in my own daily work, I actually frequently end up talking to people like \n",
      "helicopter pilots to biologists to people in  computer systems or databases to economists \n",
      "and sort of also an unending stream of  people from industry coming to Stanford \n",
      "interested in applying machine learni ng methods to their own problems.  \n",
