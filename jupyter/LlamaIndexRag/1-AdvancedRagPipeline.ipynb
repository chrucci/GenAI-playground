Additionally, you can continue reading, taking courses, and talking to domain experts to come up with new ideas. It is also helpful to focus on a specific application area where machine learning has not yet been applied. This can give you the opportunity to explore unique and creative applications that no one else has done yet. Finally, you can develop a side hustle or personal project that may not initially be part of your job but can still stir your creative juices and strengthen bonds with collaborators.\n"

      "The first step to becoming good at AI is to learn foundational technical skills.\n",
      "What are some common challenges in AI?\n",
      "Some common challenges in AI include keeping up-to-date with evolving technologies, finding suitable projects and estimating timelines and return on investment, managing the highly iterative nature of AI projects, collaborating with stakeholders who lack expertise in AI, and struggling with technical challenges while reading research papers or tuning neural network hyperparameters.\n",
      "Is it normal to find part of AI challenging?\n",
      "Yes, it is normal to find parts of AI challenging. The author mentions that they still find many research papers challenging to read and have made mistakes while working with neural networks. They also assure the reader that everyone who has published a seminal AI paper has struggled with similar technical challenges at some point. Therefore, it is clear that finding parts of AI challenging is a common experience.\n",
      "What is the right AI job for me?\n",
      "The right AI job for you will depend on your career goals and the skills you have developed. Building a portfolio of projects that shows skill progression can help you identify the right AI job for you. Additionally, using a simple framework for starting your AI job search and conducting informational interviews can help you find the right job that aligns with your interests and aspirations.\n"

It is not specific to AI but can be experienced by anyone in any field. In the context of AI, newcomers to the field may sometimes experience imposter syndrome, questioning their abilities and whether they truly belong in the AI community. The author of the text encourages individuals not to be discouraged by imposter syndrome and emphasizes that it is a common experience, even among accomplished people. The author welcomes everyone who wants to join the AI community, regardless of their doubts or insecurities.\n",
