      "When finding projects to build your experience, there are several steps you can take. First, you can join existing projects by asking to join someone else's project if they have an idea. Additionally, you can continue reading, taking courses, and talking to domain experts to come up with new ideas. It is also helpful to focus on a specific application area where machine learning has not yet been applied. This can give you the opportunity to explore unique and creative applications that no one else has done yet. Finally, you can develop a side hustle or personal project that may not initially be part of your job but can still stir your creative juices and strengthen bonds with collaborators.\n"
